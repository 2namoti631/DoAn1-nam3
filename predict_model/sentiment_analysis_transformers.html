      <td>So I’m in college and this afternoon, I had a lecture. After class I had to use the restroom. I have POTS and a service dog so I took the accessible stall in order to have room for my service dog and I’m able to hold onto the bars for stability after I stand up. Shortly after I sat down, I saw a wheelchair pull up right in front of the stall. I assumed she would see my service dogs paws underneath the door and understand that I wasn’t just taking the stall just because. Well I guess with the angle we were at, she didn’t see her paws. While I was doing my business, she said “you know this stall is for disabled people, right?” I realized she had no idea I have a disability so I decided to mess with her just a little. I replied “yes, I know, thank you.” And just sat there quietly. A couple seconds later she said “you know it’s illegal to use a handicap stall if you don’t need it.” This is absolutely NOT TRUE, at least in the US. I said “oh really?” In a sarcastic tone because at this point it was clear she was trying to embarrass me. I could hear several other girls giggling in the background. She said “yes, and I’m going to talk to the dean if you don’t get out.” I got up, flushed the toilet, and opened the door, revealing my very clearly labeled service dog. The other girls who were waiting on stalls erupted into laughter as the girl in the wheelchair went bright red. I gave her a snotty little smile and said “your turn!” As I walked out. She turned around and started apologizing profusely while I washed my hands. I said “I just really hope you don’t ever do that to someone who has a disability they can’t prove to you on the spot.” And I walked out. All the girls were still in hysterics as I walked out. So hopefully, she learned a lesson about being entitled. I swear to god it was like a scene from some kind of comedy show. I walked back to my car laughing hysterically! \n</td>

Male votes have always leaned red- however, women decisively moved towards the right this election. \n\nThe majority of white women voted Trump, with nearly 53% voting conservative. Even the young female and the broad female vote has shifted more red since 2020.\n\nIf anything, the gender divide shrank, with more men leaning blue and more women leaning red than in 2020.\n\nI just find it odd that so many women are blaming men, pushing the 4B movement, and acting shocked that so many men "betrayed their mother and daughters" when the MAJORITY of white women voted Trump, and 45% (a considerable chunk) of women as a whole voted for Trump. \n\nEven with the immense amount of campaign emphasis on women from Kamala, 1 out of every 2 voting women voted for Trump, yet the complete emphasis is placed on men voting 55%?</td>

I had a job, I had a good support system and good insurance. Surely I could drown out the impending misery of the 4 years to come by burying myself in work right? \n\n  \nWrong. I got pulled into a call this morning by HR with my boss. They did the whole schtick of "we value for your time and effort and loyalty blah blah blah but with the Trump election and incoming tariffs and uncertainty in the economic future we have to downsize and thus we are ending your employment effective immediately blah blah blah"\n\nThe worst part? I had been working closely with my boss for the past few months towards earning a promotion. I wanted to earn it and my boss and I had made a roadmap of tasks and  new duties so I could EARN a promotion by the end of the year. I was well on track and not just surviving but thriving! \n\n  \nEverything was going smoothly. Had Harris won the election, I sincerely doubt this would have happened. Maybe I am wrong, who knows. It would be super stupid to blame this on the Trump administration but hey, that was the HR person's words. Not mine. \n\n  \nI am not asking for pity, or money, lawyers, or even assistance in job hunting. Right now, I just needed this time to think and wanted a place to rant. I truly believe its time for me to leave corporate america for good and find something else that actually gives me purpose in the one life I have.</td>

      <td>So this happened a few years back. At the time I had been widowed for about 2 years. I missed my late hubby a lot so I kept his urn of ashes on my bedside table as I was in the habit of talking to him about my day and saying goodnight at bedtime. \nOne day the doorbell rang. Being the socially anxious gal that I am I ignored it. But they rang the bell 3 more gawt dang times and I became more annoyed than anxious and answered the door. \n\nTo my great displeasure there was a man at my door who wanted to talk about the state of the gutters and how desperately they needed to be cleaned. How convenient was it that this man was willing to do the vile job of cleaning the gutters for $250? .\n \nIt should be noted that I lived in a rowhome at the time and had one eavestrough that went across the edge of the roof connecting all the units and one downspout. \n\nI tried to politely decline but he kept up with his preprogrammed speech and asserted he needed to speak with “the man of the house”. \n\nCue the malicious compliance.\n\nI leaned back into the house and called my husband’s name. “Mark!” I shouted “there’s a guy at the door! Wants to talk about cleaning our gutters!!!”\n\nObviously my spouse did not respond. \n\nI shouted louder for my spouse but again he didn’t hear me or come to the door. \n\nApologizing to the man I told him I would just run upstairs and get “the man of the house”. \n\nAs promised I did run upstairs and grab Mark. I returned to the front door lamenting out loud to Mark how frustrating it is when he doesn’t respond to me calling for him and I hate it when he gives me the silent treatment. \n\n“Here’s the man of the house!” I exclaim holding the urn up like a gameshow prize.  I continued my lament to the salesman that although Mark is a great listener I’m saddened by how uninvolved he is with our children. “He’s the strong, silent type” I concluded to the now silent, bug eyed salesman. \n\nI decided to increase my dedication to the bit as well as the sales jerk’s sexist discomfort and allowed my tears to flow unfettered. Normally I loathe crying in front of strangers but the grief of losing the father of my children mixed with the rage at the arrogance and dismissive sexism lead to me sob screaming how much I hated my current life. There were tears and so much ugly crying snot sobbing noises coming out of me I didn’t even realize he had made a mad dash to get away from this hysterical woman and back to his truck. \n\nIt was cathartic for me to release those pent up emotions. Sometimes I still laugh about it with Mark. I know he definitely would be howling with laughter as he was always quite a jokester.</td>

      <td>About a month ago, I (24F) took my final exam at university, marking a huge milestone in my life. I’m the first woman in my family to achieve this, and it wasn’t an easy journey—I faced significant hardships along the way, including homelessness, domestic violence, and the loss of family members. Despite everything, I graduated with honors and earned the highest grades in my class, which made me really proud.\n\nLast night, my partner's (27M) parents hosted a big family gathering. While we were all at the dinner table, his cousin—who I get along well with—asked how it felt to be done and congratulated me on my achievement. I told him I felt proud and relieved that it was finally over.\n\nThat’s when my brother-in-law chimed in with a dismissive comment, saying something along the lines of, “It’s not that big of an achievement; people do it all the time.” His mom and a few others agreed, adding their own comments about how it’s not hard to finish a degree.\n\nThis brother-in-law has a history of putting me down, calling me “dumb” and other names, which my partner has addressed with him before. Ironically, he had once attended university himself but was kicked out for failing all his classes in the first year.\n\nUsually, I ignore his remarks, but this one caught me off guard, and I responded without my usual filter: “Then how come you got kicked out?” His mom immediately told me my comment was inappropriate and rude. She went on to say that just because he didn’t finish his degree doesn’t mean he’s wrong. I replied, “Well, if it’s so easy, why hasn’t a single one of you earned a degree?”\n\nSome family members, including my partner and the cousin, backed me up, but his mom was furious and asked me to leave.\n\nThis morning, I woke up to messages from family members. Some agreed with me, saying I had a point but could have been nicer. Others, including his mom, felt my comments were uncalled for and said I had no right to humiliate my brother-in-law.\n\nSo, AITAH?\n\n\nEdit - btw I don’t think anyone has to go to university to be successful; in fact, I believe that many people can and will accomplish incredible things without it.</td>

      <td>Tomorrow I 37F meet with my nephew who’s reckless actions caused the death of my son\n\n with the 3 years ago my nephew passed his driving test aged 18 and took me and my son for a drive. I was in the passenger seat, my 14 year old son in the back. \n\nHe was driving like an idiot, showing off to my son, he was sober but was going 50 in a 30 zone. I was screaming at him to stop or to let us out but he wouldn’t listen. I screamed at him to pull over but he looked at me and said everything was fine. And then it wasn’t \n\nHe hit a bollard and the car spiraled, the car spun and the back left side hit a wall, I was left with only a few cuts my nephew a broken leg and concussion but my priority was to get my son out of that car.\n\nI pulled him out, his head was cracked open, he was in pain he was gone in minutes. My son died in my arms because of my nephew driving like a maniac. Do you want to know the sentence he got, a 5 year suspension. He killed my son and he gets off scot free. \n\nI have avoided him for the last 3 years, he has been cut from the family but he still to this day sends apology letters and gifts to my house. I have agreed to meet him for the first time since that day, I refused to let him at my sons funeral. \n\nI’ve been thinking about if I can forgive him after all these years but the truth is I can’t and I plan to tell him so. My son was beautiful, when I think about him I remember his laugh, his personality and how he made me feel whole. But when I think about my nephew, I think about the crunch of the metal as it hit that wall, I think about the swerve of the car, I think about me yelling for him to stop and him disregarding me like it was nothing, I think about my son moaning in my arms, me covered in his blood while he’s dying, so I can’t forgive him even though I know he’s been trying to in some way apologise but I don’t want to remember my son like I do when i see him. Because I will forever carry my memories and I want to focus on the good ones, not the bad ones or the ones I’ll never get too because he was taken so soon.\n\nI plan to say all this to him and then I hope to never see him again</td>

      <td>I’m a high school English teacher. I have two major annoyances when it comes to kids doing work. \n\nFirst, a lot of kids don’t read or listen to directions. Assignment instructions are written on their papers, and I read them out loud, but I still have students asking me “What are we doing?” \n\nThat’s no big deal, though - it’s a pretty normal thing to deal with as a teacher. The real issue bugging me is students cheating on writing assignments using ChatGPT. I’m pretty good at spotting AI-generated essays. But the problem is that when I try to accuse students of using AI, they deny it. They act outraged that I would accuse them even though we both know they’re playing dumb. \n\nI usually just give them a zero and move on with my life, but there’s always the fear that one of them might take the issue to administration. If they did, I’m not confident that admin would back me up. It’s hard to prove something is AI-generated, and these days, the higher ups are more likely to side with the student. \n\nSo I hatched a plan. I gave an open-ended creative writing assignment. The directions said to “write a story about anything you want” and then answer some questions about the story you wrote. \n\nThe thing is, when you ask ChatGPT, “Tell me a story,” it always spits out the exact same story - about a girl named Elara who lives in the woods. \n\n**”Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between rolling hills and dense forests, there lived a young woman named Elara. She was known throughout the village for her curiosity and sense of adventure, always eager to explore the world beyond the familiar paths of her home.”**\n\nSo, in slightly smaller print under the instructions, I wrote **”If your main character’s name is Elara, -99 points.”**\n\nLo and behold, I got one or two kids turn in a story about a girl named Elara who lives in woods. When I turned back the papers with a grade of 1/100 (because I find that it stings more than a zero), the kids predictably asked why. And all I had to do was point to the instructions that they didn’t read. There was no need to mention AI. We both knew what they did. \n\nEdit: for people saying they tried ChatGPT and got a different story/name, I don’t know why it’s inconsistent. All I know is that I get the same story every time, and so do my students. The paragraph I put in the post was copied from ChatGPT directly. I discovered all this when a student submitted that same story earlier in the year for a different creative writing assignment.</td>

Wanted to take one more photo in AR mode and when I clicked it again my game froze… I waited a few minutes hoping it would unfreeze but it was gone. Don’t make my mistake, just catch the bird 😭 \n\nNow I just have some beautiful photos 🌅</td>

I have a 6 inch pipe and fan that goes outside with a filter for an intake with a 6 inch exhaust that goes back outside on the other side of the house. I have a timer so the fan runs every 12 hours for 15 minutes to help with air exchange. \n\nI also have a temp control to run the fan if it's colder than 45f outside to keep it cool. I also use the AC to keep it cool when it's to warm outside to cool it. I keep it around 55 once I start storing squash. \n\nI run a power meter just to see how much it cost and normally its around $30-$40 a year\n\nIf you have any questions on anything feel free to ask.\n\nPs I also have 3 deep freezers full of meat and other fruits and veggies</td>

      <td>I'm not sure if this post really fits here, but I received a call from my daughter's middle school saying she got intro trouble for fighting a group of boys. (She's a 5'1, quiet, POC middle school girl, on the spectrum, so calling it a "fight" is a stretch.) So I tried to ask the teachers what happened, but they wouldn't give me any details. Later, my daughter explained that a group of boys had been taunting her by saying, "Your body, my choice." (literally inferring to things I don't even want to type) I assume this was in response to the "My body, my choice" pin she wears on her backpack cause its something she believes in. After this happened, the school told me there was nothing they could do. So it feels like my daughters school, was lost to Qanon.</td>

One nurse, the old very set in her ways type, decided to state in front of everyone that I was “looking great” as I had “lost loads of weight”. She then asked “what have you been doing to loose that so quickly?” \n\nFor context, my dad died of Covid at age 65, my mum died age 60 nine months later of lung cancer. Both very unexpected deaths. I had just returned to work after bereavement leave following my mums death. This nurse KNEW THAT ALREADY, the room full of other nurses did not. \n\nSo in response to her question I simply answered “Yes well both my parents just died unexpectedly one after the other so the weight loss is due to the stress of that.”\n\nThe entire room gasped. The nurse in questions face turned purple from embarrassment. She has never asked me a question again in handover.</td>

      <td>I, 35f, have 4 children with my husband, 30m. I am having a hard time writing this, I keep infodumping unimportant details and have to re-write. Basically, every time my husbans has been in charge of BC we end up with another child.\n\nWe used Condoms when we got pregnant with our twins ( 6) and we had no pregnancies for 2 years because I had an IUD. Car accident injury ended up needing us to use Condoms for a while. Pregnant immediately. Baby was born (3). I got pregnant again IMMEDIATELY(2).\n\nFor almost a year and a half, I have been pushing him to get a vasectomy. There is ALWAYS a reason that it's not the time. He had to reschedule an appointment ONE time and then it just never happened. Every time I bring it up it seems I am starting from the beginning. I can't be on hormonal BC because of medication issues.\n\nEarly this year I went through a pregnancy that I lost. It was a Rollercoaster of emotions because it was not planned and we live in a state where a choice wasn't an option, and while I wasnt opposed to another child in the future, not NOW. I was dealing with a lot of anger from my husband and parents and then everyone just refused to acknowledge the pregnancy. I lost the baby at about 19 weeks. He left me to go to work in the middle of it. I should have gone to a hospital, but couldnt unless i was going to take all of my kids with me. He then took a day off of work 4 days later for a stuffy nose (so basically alone still with him in the house). I have not recovered emotionally.\n\nTwo days ago we wakes me up for intimacy and I ask to make sure he has a condom. He asks really? It's in a different room (the bathroom). I have to ask a second time, I even use the words “I can't get pregnant again” so gets one. He doesn't put it on until I remind a third time. Part way through he says something like “I just can't” and it is only at the end that I realize he has removed the condom when a mess is made.\n\nI didn't say anything at the moment. I don't know why I didn't seem to really process what was going on. I was tired when it started, I enjoyed the activity, and I told him I love him even after I realized what went on.\n\nI am having problems because I am so upset with him but I am so excited to be around him I forget how violated i feel. I feel insane. I feel like it's Stockholm syndrome and I am watching myself through a window. I watch this person posses me who is just so happy to talk to this person who used to be the only thing that ever made me feel safe.\n\nI have been alternating between being angry with him and shaking with rage, and sobbing. He is at work and I have sent him a text that we need to talk tonight right before I typed this out. He gets off of work in 5 hours and I have just been shaking and a wreck. I am so scared I going to wind up pregnant again. Losing the last one almost killed me (literally) and I don't want him to touch me again until I know his touch wont kill me. It feels so at odds because he's my only safe place. My only comfort, and he's the one who hurt me. \n\nI don't think this conversation will go well. He is so reasonable untill eyes are on him for accountability. But it has to happen now, and frankly I don't know if our relationship will handle the conversation going poorly after everything I have gone through this year. I am tired, and now I'm going to be scared untill I bleed again. Does he not care…? I just don't think trust him anymore after this, and I think I am having a hard time accepting that. I don't think there is any other step forward to repairing this relationship than him getting fixed. I don't think anything else will be enough ever again.\n\nI am sorry this post is a mess. I am a mess and this is the best I can do. I feel like I'm going to have an anxiety attack just posting this I need to get my wits about me so I'm not all emotional when I talk to him, I just want to make sure I'm not crazy.

Selling them was too tedious and the final straw was when I got scammed by someone who said they never received the card I sent them. I figured it would serve a better purpose in someone's collection than just sitting in a binder that I never look at. \n\nWith that said, I will be doing a giveaway. I will choose one person through a random comment picker and they'll get to choose any 3 of the cards listed below, even if they want two or more of the same card. \n\n- (4) Charizard holo 11/108\n- (1) Reverse holo Charizard 11/108\n- (2) Charizard EX 12/108\n- (1) M Charizard EX 13/108\n- (1) Black star promo Charizard XY29\n\nI will choose a winner on November 13th at 12pm CST. The only thing I'll need from the winner is their shipping address. I'll take care of everything else. If you'd like to enter just leave a comment saying what your favorite Pokémon card is of all-time. \n\nGood luck and take care!</td>

      <td>My uncle John has a super fun way to make kids cry. He will get the oil from lemon rinds and touch balloons. Sometimes they pop immediately sometimes they take a few seconds.\n\nAt every party I have ever attended, where there were balloons and children, he left a trail of torn latex and crying children.\n\nMy parents think it's all in good fun. I think he is a prick.\n\nMy sister had her Quinceañera last week. My contribution was a balloon arch. My siste bwas obviously turning 15 and didn't really care about balloons. But we got some very nice pictures with the arch. Then I set it up outside on some astroturf.\n\nA few other people used it for pictures as well. Then my uncle showed up. I went up to him and told him that I had paid for the arch for my baby sister's party and that I wanted him to leave it alone.\n\nHe said he would.\n\nHe did not.\n\nI didn't want any accidents inside so I didn't add the three balloons with fart spray to the arch until I moved it outside. And the balloons were double baggers. I had blown up one inside another before I inflated the outer one.\n\nBut you could see the inside balloon.\n\nIt was too much of a temptation. He resisted for ten minutes or so. Then someone came and told me. I went out. He was about to pick up the inner balloon and I TOLD him not to touch it. And to stop blowing up the decorations.\n\nHe didn't listen. He said he wasn't doing anything except touching the balloons. And that it wasn't his fault they were popping.\n\nSo be it.\n\nHe picked up the inner balloon. It wasn't as inflated as the outer on so the surface tension was lesser. Therefore it took almost two seconds for the balloon he was holding so proudly to pop.\n\nGagging, dry heaving, watery eyes, a profound desire to be elsewhere. I went through all that. I cannot imagine what it would be like to be drenched in the liquid form of fart spray. Drenched is n overstatement. There was maximum half a fluid ounce of fart liquid in the balloon.\n\nBut he was covered in it. And the pop did aerosolize it somewhat so it got all over.\n\nHe ended up having to go home and change. It was only like half an hour he was gone. Maybe an hour. I wasn't paying attention.\n\nHe did come back though. Freshly showered. And he is pissed that I would play such a childish prank at such an important event for my family.\n\nI said I had no idea what he was talking about. I reminded him that he had promised to leave the balloons alone and that I had warned him not to touch the balloon that got him.\n\nMy family are divided. They think I was a jerk to play a joke at my sister's party. But they are almost universally sick of him popping balloons.\n\nMy grandfather laughed his ass off.\n\nOriginal post:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1glj8c3/aitah_for_using_fart_spray_to_get_my_uncle_to/\n\nI am not OOP.

      <td>I just remembered a story for my last job that I think would be perfect for r/pettyrevenge \n\nWhen I was working for local government I was manning the phones on the service desk. We were about to finish for the day, like we were preemptively putting our coats on because we were about to sign off and leave, that's how close we were to 5pm. At 4:59:45, 15 seconds before the phone lines closed, someone decides to call the service desk. Let's call her Jane A. Jane had issues logging into her mobile phone, ok, easy, probably needs a quick password reset, it'll take a few minutes to do and we'll be on our way. Oh boy was I wrong. She decided that this was MY fault, demanded to talk to the mobiles guy who had already left for the day at 4pm and that was also my fault. \n\nSeeing where this was going I popped her in mute while she was rambling and asked my manager if I could hang up because she was rude. My manager took this opportunity to listen in to the call from her desk and what came was absolutely mind blowing. \n\nFor almost 30 minutes I was screamed at by Jane, who decided that she didn't want any of my help because it was all somehow my fault. I offered to pass it right over to the mobiles guy so be could pick it up first thing in the morning because if she doesn't want to go through troubleshooting steps to help her out then there's nothing else I can do. More screaming continued, I was meant to go home 30 minutes ago and was now being verbally abused during my unplanned overtime. I killed her with nothing but kindness which didn't work. \n\nShe agreed to let the mobiles guy pick it up after another 10 mins of screaming. \n\nWe hung up and I broke down because I was so angry I couldn't say anything to her. I was in tears. My manager was furious with her. Worst of it all is she's a colleague, she couldn't believe that she'd speak to a colleague that way. \n\nThe next morning my manager brought in a box of chocolates for me and went straight to our department leader to complain. \n\nI got a letter a week later from Jane, apologising to me. \n\nThen all of a sudden, she disappears. No active directory profile for her, she'd been fired. \n\nTurned out she was actually using another colleagues account for her mobile phone and accessing their files. Janes colleague, who also shared the same first name (let's call her Jane B), worked in child protection and Jane A was accessing files she had no business getting into. MASSIVE GDPR breach. She got hold of Jane B's username and password. She passed all the security checks using Jane B's information and got herself fired. All because she couldn't access Jane B's mobile phone and threw a fit to the person who had enough patience to let her scream at them for 40 minutes. \n\nI got extra pay for those 40 minutes, a box of chocolates, an apology and she got herself fired for verbally abusing me and getting investigated by the IT department</td>

      <td>(throwaway account for obvious reasons)\n\n19M here, so a few days ago I received the package for a posture corrector I found on Amazon 'cuz lately my back's slanting forward due to sitting in front of the computer for hours (CS degree, heh). My roommate pointed it out too, saying that I sit like that meme of the shrimp in front of the laptop. \n\nAnyway, it arrived and I tested it out. It honestly felt kind of uncomfortable but at least it straightened my back so I didn't bother further about it. It was also quite difficult to put on.\n\nDuring the next days I'd wear it at home after lectures, and go on evening jogs with it on. I got some weird looks from a few people who were walking but I didn't pay too much attention, I mean who'd look at a jogger like that for no reason?\n\nNo reason, right? ***RIGHT?***\n\nWell, unfortunately, they had a reason.\n\nMy roommate hadn't seen the posture corrector yet since he was away for a few days at some uni excursion, and he just arrived back today during the afternoon. Like usual, I was wearing it while working on the laptop.\n\nHe enters my room and:\n\nHe: Uh... why are you wearing *that*?\n\nMe: Oh, this? I ordered it recently, it's a posture corrector.\n\nHe: *raises eyebrows* Yeah yeah "posture corrector", that's literally bondage.\n\nMe: **... w h a t ?**\n\nSurprise surprise, turns out this thing I was wearing was actually some leather BDSM bondage for the back... FUCK\n\nI'm literally dying of embarrassment rn, I went out in the evening wearing THAT. I seriously hope that none of the people walking outside are from my uni because the last thing I want is to go down as some exhibitionist. My roommate now has more ammunition to joke about me, damn it.\n\nTL;DR I ordered BDSM bondage thinking it was a posture corrector and embarrassed myself, my roommate, and some pedestrians.</td>

      <td>I've never built kitchen cabinets before, so go easy on me.  I also would have chose a more fun color, but my wife insisted on white.  I replumbed the waterheater and moved it down to the cellar, rewired the water heater, added 4 more electrical outlets, built all cabinets from scratch, made all the doors for the cabinets in my new-to-me router table, installed sink, replaced floor, and trimmed everything out.  It's a tough job doing this all while having to care for a baby and not get any help with the project from anybody.  Took me about 8 months to do this but I only worked 1 day a week on it, sometimes 2 days per week.  I also don't have a garage and my cellar/basement is not a suitable workplace, so I had to carry my tools out of the basement and work in the driveway every day.  My legs are a lot stronger now.  \n\nIn the first picture, the water heater is in the kitchen and it had a weird box framed around it that didn't go all the way to the ceiling.  I had already removed that before I took pictures.   None of the cabinetry in the kitchen was original to the 1904 house.   I also originally planned on ripping up the sheet vinyl and refinishing the douglas fir floors underneath, but I ran into asbestos linoleum under the old sheet vinyl.   :(</td>

Since I haven't been active in a while, I give general permissions on all my mods. But this person had a lot of transphobic rhetoric on their website - calling it "absolute insanity" while at the same time praising my work. \n\nI'm nonbinary. I've been transitioning for a few years now, but identifying as nonbinary for about nine years.\n\n If 63 percent of people don't know a transgender person, then we can be more easily scapegoated and our human rights denied as "identity politics". For us, transgender rights isn't a hypothetical, or something that can be calculated away as politically risky - it's our life experience, and things are about to get a whole lot worse for us everywhere, in every country... because we've now been proven to be a *useful* scapegoat. There is nowhere to run. Everyone I know who is trans is terrified, and there's a black pit in my heart where hope used to be, even if there wasn't much there to begin with.\n\nAnd if 63 percent of people don't know a transgender person, that percentage may not even notice when we're gone. \n\nSo, if you've ever enjoyed my mods, even if they're silly and self-indulgent, you can now say you know a transgender person! And you probably know more of us than you think. Please try to remember that in the coming days.</td>

      <td>I was at a job for 3 years before switching. I liked my job but I needed more money and this place gave a decent offer. It's a family like business with a back end repair shop and a front office. I was to work the front office. Today was my fifth day on the job. Work starts at 7:30. I got there at 7:20. I put my lunch in the fridge, got coffee and sat at my desk. I logged in to my computer and started up the software I've been working with the past week. I checked my email and I waited instructions from my boss who was in her office. At 7:40 my boss fired me for not being proactive and asking what I was supposed to be doing. I was upset to say the least. I talked with an employment lawyer and since I quit my last job to work at this job and got fired for non misconduct reasons I have the ability to file for unemployment. This is the most unprofessional establishment I have ever been apart of and the company doesn't have a Glassdoor account I can blast them on. Yesterday my coworker told me I was the 4th person they have hired in for my position in 3 years. When I asked if there was a reason for this, she laughed and said "yes". I'm glad to be out of there. I have another position lined up for December. I almost wish I didn't so I could file for 20 weeks of unemployment with this slimy company. Oh well. Life goes on. Working fucking sucks. There's no moral to this story. This is just a rant.</td>

      <td>My girlfriend (both mid 20s) and I have been together 2 years and live in Canada. My girlfriend has been very invested in this election, and has been spending a lot of time on social media. A couple days ago after hearing that Trump won, she told me that she is going on a "sex strike" to show solidarity with the women whose lives will be negatively affected by a new Trump presidency.\n\nWe haven't recently had any disagreements, and we were very regularly having sex before Nov 5th. We don't live together, but she has always told me I've treated her better than any other guy before. I did ask her if this is about something else she denied anything. Unless she's lying to me, her motivation seems to be purely political.\n\nYes I understand that women aren't obligated to give men sex and whatnot, but I genuinely do think her reasoning makes zero sense because:\n* We aren't even citizens of the United States, let alone live there. I couldn't have voted for Trump even if I wanted to. I had literally nothing to do with the outcome of this election so I don't understand why I'm effectively being punished for it?\n* I am personally in favour of abortion and have answered honestly about that when asked.\n* I think that the whole idea of weaponizing sex sets a very bad precedent for relationship dynamics.\n* She and I both believe that men and women both enjoy sex just as much as each other, and that sex isn't something women just "do" to keep men happy.\n\nI do love my girlfriend and I really want her to come around, but I'm pretty sure I can't even attempt to express my concerns without being accused of being entitled to sex. And to be quite frank, the fact that she hopped on a TikTok bandwagon so quickly, and the fact that she's effectively withholding sex as a carrot and stick, is a huge turn off for me. \n\nI do want sex, and I would like to be with a woman who wants to have sex with me. As much as it sucks, I feel like my best course of action is to break up with her and let her have her sex strike in peace.\n\nAm I wrong?\n</td>

      <td>So, I (18F) have a very fluffy, very adorable cat named Mochi. He’s basically my little buddy, and he’s got one of those Instagram accounts where I post his funny antics, so a lot of people in my neighborhood know about him. *Including* this one mom I’ll call EM, who has a 6-year-old daughter super into cats. No biggie, right?\n\nOne day, EM messages me on Instagram, saying her daughter is “absolutely OBSESSED” with Mochi and asking if I could bring him to her daughter’s birthday party the following weekend so the kids can “play with him.” I politely decline, explaining that Mochi doesn’t do well in new environments and would likely hide or freak out around loud kids.\n\nEM’s response? “Well, can you *loan* him to us for the day?” Yes, she literally wanted me to just *hand over my cat* as if he were a library book or something. She promised they’d “take good care of him” and even offered to pay me $20 “for the inconvenience.”\n\nI politely refuse again, saying that Mochi isn’t up for loan, and I don’t think it would be safe or comfortable for him. EM immediately switches tactics, calling me “selfish” and accusing me of “gatekeeping joy” from her daughter. She rants about how it’s “just one day,” and I “owe it to the community” because I “flaunt” Mochi’s photos online.\n\nNow I’m getting irritated. I tell her that my cat isn’t an accessory, and he’s definitely not something I “owe” to the neighborhood. I assume that’s the end of it… until the day of the party.\n\nI’m in my apartment when I hear a loud knock at my door. It’s EM and her daughter, with the girl holding a sparkly cat carrier. EM smiles and says, “Oh, we came to pick up Mochi!” She acts as if we had agreed on this and just expected me to hand him over on demand.\n\nCompletely stunned, I tell her, “I never agreed to this, and I’m not giving you my cat.” EM’s smile drops instantly, and she launches into this loud, dramatic rant about how I’m “ruining her daughter’s special day” and that I “shouldn’t show off my cat if I don’t want to share.” Her daughter starts tearing up, and EM gives me this *accusing look,* like I’ve just broken her kid’s heart on purpose.\n\nMy neighbor down the hall actually poked her head out to see what was going on, which was enough for EM to grab her daughter and storm off, yelling, “I’ll make sure everyone knows how selfish you are!”\n\nLater, I found out from mutual friends that she spread a story around the neighborhood that I “baited” her daughter with Mochi, “only to withhold him out of spite.” No one really believed her, but she still gives me *the dirtiest looks* anytime I pass her.\n\nMochi? Completely oblivious and unbothered, living his best life as usual.\n\nEDIT: the cat has passed away, sorry, dont ask for "cat tax" out of respect, i do love my late cat and i wanted to relive an old memory, so thats why im writing this.</td>

      <td>[the Chimbridge Dictionary of Singlish and Singaporean Terminology](https://singlish-dict.vercel.app/)\n\nHi,\n\nFor the past few months in my free time I've been compiling the most comprehensive Singlish dictionary project I believe has ever been attempted to date. This builds on the works of previous dictionaries such as the one by Jack Lee et al. at SMU, which was quite well researched for its time, and the now-defunct Coxford dictionary. However, like many others, it is missing thousands of common terms, and almost half the etymologies are wrong or just not provided (as there were understandably much fewer resources for several origin languages back then).\n\nI have tried to approach it from as academic a perspective as possible, because I believe it's a light our language is rarely portrayed in outside of academic papers and uni theses. I think it deserves this treatment just like any other language does, rather than how it's often stereotyped by the ignorant as an "unstandardized" and "broken" language.\n\nIt isn't perfect and I have definitely made mistakes in several pages while doing this alone (please let me know if you come across any), but hopefully it can be used as a solid reference for anyone interested in the language. In any case one of the reasons I did it was because I was annoyed at the amount of fake/hearsay etymology out there lol. I've also got some very interesting discoveries, tidbits, and etymologies about many terms which I might expand on further if there's any interest.\n\n\nFeatures include:\n\n1. Searching for Singlish terms (with as many variant spellings as I could reasonably fit accepted)\n\n2. Searching for Singlish terms via English meanings\n\n3. Languages of origin page complied for the entire corpus of Singlish terms\n\n4. Categories and A-Z pages</td>

      <td>Everyone piling into Tesla, Bitcoin, DJT, etc. and no one ever mentioned Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These two companies have been orphaned ever since their conservatorship 15+ years ago. During Trump's first presidency he implemented steps to re-privatize the entities and with him back in office the market reacted accordingly. I started building my position in the junior preferreds a little over a year ago.\n\nShould mention that there is still room to run. Most of the junior preferred issues are trading at around 30% of their face value. I only hold the junior preferred shares as the common will most likely get wiped in any recap and release scenario. \n\nIt will be interesting to see who Trump picks as his treasury secretary in the coming weeks. John Paulson is one of the names being floated around - he famously bet against subprime mortgages during the GFC and holds a large amount of Fannie and Freddie junior preferreds. \n\n[Ignore other financial company holdings - virtually all gains coming from Fannie and Freddie JPS](https://preview.redd.it/q6o6mipgprzd1.png?width=1025&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=880dad11ef1c86ff4ed5d4820b8d206e1d20ab87)\n\n  \n</td>

Another defense is, "atleast their honest unlike other fast food chains" but atleast other fast food chains aren't  selling you gigantic sized 8 stack burgers. Also their food is just generally slop from what I've heard. How they are still in business with their legal loopholes and dry heart attack prone burgers is a miracle.</td>

      <td>The rise of misinformation was already rampant. Charlatans without credentials have become influencers. Now, the existential threat of pseudoscience and the “Make America Healthy Again” under Trump &amp; RFK Jr to our evidence-based profession is already having an effect. \n\nSo many nurses of all levels are buying into dogma instead of rigorous science. They’re now concerned with dyes in our food rather than food insecurity in general. They’ve chosen to demonize “chemicals” instead of being advocates for access to quality healthcare (including preventative practices) and education. \n\nI joined this profession because it used to be a blend of compassionate care and scientific progress. The progress is being undone and now we have to spar with concepts that have little to no scientific validity (or integrity). \n\nI am tired. As a nurse practitioner trained in clinical research, I am ashamed of what our profession has come to and tired of feeling like we need to now do more work to fight for justice and truth. \n\nWhat do we do?! Part of me wants to just move to a better country. Part of me feels bad to abandon my community.</td>
