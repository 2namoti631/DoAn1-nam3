Comment,m3oxlxg,1hltb9r,Glavurdan,"[ISW update for December 24th](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-december-24-2024).

Key takeaways:

* A senior Russian official reiterated Russian President Vladimir Putin's insistence that negotiations with Ukraine must be based on the same uncompromising demands he made before the full-scale invasion and at the moment of Russia's greatest territorial gains, despite the fact that Ukraine has liberated significant amount of territory since then.
* The Kremlin's economic limitations will likely hinder its efforts to impose policies combatting long-term demographic decline in Russia.
* A Russian cargo ship sank in the Mediterranean Sea on December 23, possibly while traveling from St. Petersburg to Vladivostok via Syria and Libya.
* The United States provided Ukraine on December 24 with the first tranche of loans generated solely from profits from frozen Russian assets.
* Russian forces recently advanced near Pokrovsk, Toretsk, Vuhledar, Velyka Novosilka, and in Kursk Oblast.
* Russian Security Council Deputy Chairperson Dmitry Medvedev claimed on December 24 that 440,000 recruits signed military service contracts with the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) in 2024.",38,1735099596.0

Another one. A couple of months ago I thought that Putin is doing everything to be an antithesis of Peter the Great:

One opened the window to the Europe, one closed it.

One encouraged(with taxes) to cut off beards, one is all for ""traditional values""

One established the navy by learning to build the ships. One had ""Она утонула"" (Kursk submarine) major event, but one such event doesn't exactly count as ""destroying navy"". But now having so many ships sink in short period of time, even without the help of Ukranian drones, I think navy is maimed enough to count for ""don't be like Peter"" navy achievement.

If the trend continues, Sweden and Turkey will be countries who'll managed to get the victory against Russia. We've even seen Bayraktar in the beginning which had its own theme song.",17,1735108041.0

Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei denied that Iran uses proxy forces in the region, asserting that groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis act independently out of their own faith and beliefs, not as agents of the Islamic Republic.

In a meeting with religious eulogizers on Sunday, Khamenei addressed what he described as ""absurd statements from Western and Israeli officials,"" dismissing the notion that Iran’s regional influence is based on the use of proxy forces.

""They constantly say that the Islamic Republic has lost its proxy forces in the region! This is another mistake! The Islamic Republic does not have proxy forces. Yemen fights because of its faith; Hezbollah fights because its faith gives it strength to fight; Hamas and Jihad fight because their beliefs compel them to do so,"" Khamenei said.

In recent months, due to the war in Lebanon and Hezbollah's stance, relations between Assad and the Iranians had deteriorated.

I'd love to write all of those people, and Trump himself, off as somewhere on the scale from hypocritical to heretical, but taking a ""no true Christian"" approach and moving on ignores that there is a deep and pervasive sickness in the American Christian Church, across most major denominations, that needs to be confronted.

What Putin did:
-Established global corruption to constantly leech all the resources from largest country in the world into pockets of his loyal and equally dumb friends.
-Doesnt give a fuck about ideology. Yes, that's right. Putin gives zero fucks about ""russian world"" from his propagandistic TV. So basically started all russia wide schizophrenia.
-Caused so much trouble in russian laws it will take decades to clean this mess.
- Values personal loyalty over competency, so he's constantly surrounded by yes-guys, which only makes things worse for Russia.
-Failed to establish relationships with China after cutting all connections with the West, so now Russia is pretty much isolated from the global market and has to pay x3-x4 times for everything.
-Caused largest brain drain of russian specialists, scientists, etc. to the West.
-Spends more money on internal political repressions than on the war. That's why russian prisons are full of political dissidents. And thats why conscripts are forced to fight in Ukraine, while regular military guards Putin's ass (especially after Prigozhin performance)

And at the same time he does just enough to not lose Ukraine war, and not enough to win it. He could went full Saddam and start real genocide (I know how it sounds, but with Putin's resources shit could be much much worse). IMO he's convenient af. I'm starting to think he's CIA agent or something - he caused more damage to Russia than all the opposing forces combined.

Comment,m3phxl0,m3per5t,zzlab,"Common misconception. It is a bit tricky but bear with me. Christmas is effectively on the same date in all christian denominations, but the difference depends on which calendar a church uses. The whole world is using the Gregorian calendar, meanwhile backward russian church and many countries which had the terrible luck of being occupied by russia for most of the 20th century stubbornly stuck to the outdated Julian calendar. The difference between two calendars is 2 weeks, which turns 25 Dec into 7 Jan on the Julian calendar.

Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas on 25 Dec, but if their church is subservient to russian church or hasn't reformed since the time it was, that date turns into 7 Jan on the real-world calendar.

TLDR: russian church is not the same as Orthodox Christian church. The way bacwards russia does Christmas is not how Orthodox Christianity does Christmas. Important to remember this next time somebody accuses Ukraine of going against Orthodox church.",8,1735111559.0

I agree that radiation from the accretion disk wouldn’t be survivable, something the movie never touched on. But I was only commenting on the possibility of Interstellar’s depiction of time dilation due to the gravity of being near the EH. Sure the difference in curvature between the surface of the planet compared to the planets orbit might be minuscule, but the curvature experience on the surface would be steeper if you factor the planets own mass.

Ironically enough, adding that gps data in a conflict zone is no greater risk than using starlink by itself in a conflict zone, radio emissions can always be triangulated so it’s not like starlink is impossible to find just because it’s not explicitly sending gps data with its transmissions by default.

I wouldn’t use starlink anywhere I wanted to stay for longer than I had to, basically. Even using a handheld radio could start a timer for things to get really loud really quickly if you’re a big enough target, it’s just a good idea to take cover or get going if you’re making that much noise in general.",1,1735099667.0

You also have to keep in mind that Ukranians on the front lines don't necessarily have the time or luxury to submit a support ticket, do a password reset, or submit a bug report. While I'm sure some things are being done, they have to be careful about not creating a lot of barriers for Ukranians to use it and if they get it wrong it could cost Ukranian lives. It's not like a residential ISP in a peaceful city.

Also Ukraine and NATO don't have the luxury of coming out and saying ""We want some Starlink access inside Russian borders because we need Ukraine to be able to use it to target military sites"", but that's most likely the case. They also can't come out and say whether they're tracking Russian black market use of Starlink to provide an intelligence advantage to Ukraine, even if that was the case.",10,1735081189.0
Comment,m3nwws1,m3nuhdi,RagaToc,"I'm sorry but it is easy to do whitelist based on hardware id and a certain region.

This needs to be done once per dish and can be done before the dish is shipped to the frontline in the initial check. That they are doing to check if the dish is working and to connect it to their subscription. 

Starlink needs to create some additional capability on their end.  But many vendors have done similar things where an appliance bought in Japan doesn't work in the US.

It will be more difficult for random people to buy starlink dishes for random Ukraine units. But even that can be worked with.  The question how big the problem really is,  how much intel is Russia leaking to the US/Ukraine with this and how willing is SpaceX to really help Ukraine. 

Additionally I think Ukraine's army might be swapping over to starshield (the US defense variant) and than the question becomes that soon they might just shut down Starlink in Russia and near the frontline (assuming SpaceX cooperates and the US government still wants to sanction Russia).",5,1735082234.0

Yes, Ukranians do not have that luxury, but I'd expect Starlink being quite documented on which and how many batches of hardware they sent after the US Gov. paid them. Yes, this doesn't include the hardware Ukranians and the Ukranian Gov got using other ways, but there is military back channels that can handle this kind of topics. So it's not impossible to ""register"" every dish being used by the Ukranian military and then applying a blanket ban over Ukraine and russia.

“In September, Ukrainian news outlet Defense Express reported the discovery of crashed Shaheds fitted with Starlink satellite communications. This provide long-range communications, allowing the Russian to track their drones in real time and determine which ones are downed before they reach their targets, as well as re-routing them in flight.

Obviously the Russian use of the U.S-made Starlink is highly illegal, but many posts on social media apparently show Russian troops taking delivery of Starlinks, likely through agents in third-party countries.

When combined with a thermal imaging camera, the satellite link would allow the operator to home in precisely on specific targets, especially those with an obvious heat signature such as electricity generation equipment. With real time communication Shaheds can attack moving targets such as shipping, and precision targets such as air defenses. They could also assess the effect of previous strikes”

Comment,m3noi7i,m3nmnoi,RemyLavigne,"To tag onto this.  SatCom terminals with sdm (software defined modems) also have registration keys that enable them to terminate onto a constellation.  This means that if a terminal is registered as Ukrainian, then it can remain 'live'.  In the opposite, a terminal that does not have a registration key for Ukraine can be blocked in a region.  

The hard part is knowing what terminals Ukrainian troops actually have and grouping them under a certain identifier so that they aren't cut off.  Also with that, we don't know if other European nations have sent those terminals to Ukraine.  

Add in the opsec issues with a civ US wildcard company knowing the location of all the Ukrainian formations.... And you have a much messier problem set.",18,1735078748.0

I don't think it's hard. On the Starlink website, it shows the antenna on a map and it's about 10 meters off. That's pretty good. I assume they can block you on a per antenna basis, otherwise how would they block people who don't pay?

I am going to argue that at this point there are (STILL) overwhelmingly large segments of humanity that are quite literally not psychologically evolved enough beyond neanderthal-level empathy… that a LOT of people are simply not capable of empathy towards other humans.

Their goals are to eat, sleep, work, follow religion, and fuck. That’s it.

Perhaps most of us here in North America and Western Europe (including Aus./NZ) wrongly assumed that most of humanity was “ready” to jump forward into a future of relative peace and maybe become “one humanity” under the guidance of western democratic values and ethics after some more decades of time.

We were wrong. So very, very wrong.

We started seeing how wrong we were once COVID happened… and we saw China, a place where western society placed a lot of their economic hopes and dreams, actively betray the entire world and hoarded medical supplies for themselves, barely trying to manage the virus, instead of trying to help save the rest of humanity by truly trying to nobly contain the virus early.

Then Russia started a war in Europe (yes, Ukraine is part of Europe), a phenomenon thought impossible just 5 years ago.

It’s unraveled even further with Trump’s reelection in the USA, the world’s lone superpower, with even the popular vote in his favor…

It seems we are to repeat the last several centuries of war and infighting.

The only thing that ever advances is our technology. The human condition is fucking nearly impossible to change for the better. And it’s so frustrating!

I’ve even seen some crazy folks suggesting mass genetic engineering to induce greater empathy among future children… essentially breaking our own ethics and morals on such a thing.",4,1735101930.0

# 'Europeans with blue eyes, blonde hair being killed': Media coverage of Ukraine criticised for racism

  
On *BBC News*, Ukraine’s deputy chief prosecutor David Sakvarelidze explained being very emotional as he was seeing “European people with blue eyes and blonde hair being killed everyday”.

On *CBS News*, foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata was reporting from Kyiv. He said, “This is a relatively civilised, relatively European city where you wouldn’t expect that or hope that it is going to happen.” He also said this wasn't ""Iraq or Afghanistan"" – countries that are clearly synonymous with conflict. D'Agata later apologised in a broadcast.

  
Should I feel sorry for Ukrainians because they are Aryans? Haven't westerners been ignoring human sufferings in Africa and Asia? Should I feel more sorry for Ukraine? I'm not defending that ruthless dictator Putin. He is clearly the aggressor here, but why should I feel more sorry for Ukrainians? Is it just because they are white?

Comment,m3oufzn,m3oso1d,_zenith,"No, I think it’s a real shame that more interest isn’t being shown in the suffering in Africa, to pick one example… but I also think it’s understandable, being in a different continent entirely and with a totally different culture (well, many different cultures, actually, Africa being a very large and diverse place) - and one that has shown more and more forcefulness towards not wanting Western intervention. We also have Westerners who are more aware of their past mistakes in both colonialism and military intervention, and who worry we will just make things worse if we intervene again (and they will hate us more for it), even if that might not be always true.

I also think there is some validity in saying it’s not like Iraq or Afghanistan, however, because in those cases it was very difficult to convince the locals to help out (and they were notoriously terrible even when they did, showing up to training high on opium to pick just one aspect…), whereas Ukrainians already had a democracy, and they were willing to fight for it.

Comment,m3n3u9k,m3mj0ro,SpiritTunnel,"I think on the practice reframing speaking about individuals taking the critical step of enacting the end of their own life. I disagree on endorsing the removal of commit and simply saying died by suicide. To my values I disagree with the mode of thinking that treats killing oneself to be under the umbrella of something reduced to just x disease. I think it divorces the act from the human behind it. 

Take for instance that photo of a person who self immolated themselves on the street. 

They committed an act of protest.

To me commit does not = bad. And I disagree with conforming the usage of it to just be reserved for unpleasant things because it is most heard for things that have a connotation of wrong. And I think why i went out to comment is, our usage of language and how we apply constraints on our speech to alternative ways of communicating the same thing, when we are doing that out of things i find lamentable like conforming to what is deemed advertiser friendly on a media platform, or neutralizing the unpleasant nature of something.  

I think another example to me is the one individual who ended their life because of their disease with a chronic severe pain. They had sought death with dignity, as the pain was untreatable. and it couldn't't get approved with red tape so they took their own life.

To me I don't want to reduce that to simply died by suicide because x They committed to an act. It was suicide and these things have humans behind them.

From day one he had started undermining independent courts, journalists, secularism, rule of law. He just masked his power consolidation as 'accepting institutional norms' and hid under the 'I respect minorities' and 'I'm a Islamic-Democrat' mask.

One only has to look at some of his choice quotes, like when he was mayor of Istanbul in the 90's, and said [""Democracy is like a tram. You ride it until you arrive at your destination""](https://www.turkeyinstitute.org.uk/commentary/democracy-like-tram/), or the speech that got him arrested where he said:

""Our minarets are our bayonets, our domes are our helmets, our mosques are our barracks. We will put a final end to ethnic segregation. No one can ever intimidate us.
If the skies and the ground were to open against us, if floods and volcanoes were to burst, we will not turn from our mission. My reference is Islam. If I am not able to speak of this, what is the use of living?""

The mask started to slip in 2011 when he ran out of eligible terms to run for PM. So he did a Putin and ran for President in the next election, then changed the constitution so the President now holds the most power. This was coupled with his purges following the 2016 coup attempt and him suddenly switching from his pro-minority stance to a strictly Islamic nationalist stance around the same time.

The moderate ""Islamic-Democrat"" Erdogan was just a convenient mask to consolidate power, nothing else. He still brings out the mask on occasion when it's convenient, but know well that this is not the real Erdogan, his actions and words indicate otherwise.",12,1735083194.0

* Sharia for Muslims only ,Christians and other minorities  are under  secular law( North Africa, Syria under Assad, Jordan, Oman, UAE, Somalia 
* everyone is under the Sharia law: 12 countries out of 48 Muslim majority countries

Christmas trees were adopted from ancient pagan traditions. Most likely to convert more pagans to monotheistic religions. 

Kinda similar to how the ancient Greeks, Roman (yes, Roman Catholicism was the new “Fetch” thing) Gods suddenly became saints. 

They took the tradition and made it their own. It’s fun learning how actually connected history, culture, religion is very similar when you think about it and reflect.

YES, it's about idols. Not trees for another holiday. Yours is a LONG debunked myth of where Christians got this from. Look at other translations and they directly reference idols being fashioned. The vast majority render it as fashioning idols. Unless you are prepared to convincly argue that craftsmen work trees with chisels to... Shape them into Christmas tree shaped trees?

No I'm not. I'm simply saying that Christians who demand public acceptance of their beliefs shouldn't bitch if they aren't willing to have public acceptance of other beliefs. 

>You cant get mad at random Christians

I'm not, I don't give a shit if some Christians are salty that their town is changing the name of a Christmas festival to a winter festival to include people who don't celebrate Christmas.

>wanting to celebrate Christmas publicly because some other Christians didn’t want muslims celebrating

I don't know England's laws but in the US Christians can publicly celebrate Christmas at their church but cities or states shouldn't be sponsoring festivals for specific religions.

Precisely because everyone is watching this is very likely to be a case of preparing to fight the last war.

They don't learn to fight aircraft which is a major part of any war with S. Korea and they do learn how to use drones in an environment where using drones is relatively easy while protecting against homemade experimental drones.

They would essentially be learning how to fight tanks by observing British Mk1's. Byond seeing that this technology is likely to be widely used in the future, any actual lessons learned will be limited by the fact that the tech is very much in it's infancy and will change significantly in a short amount of time.

Now, if they were the only ones seeing the benefit of drone warfare, that would be one thing, but they're desperately late to the party. Their enemies have been investing in military drones for 2 decades and while knowing how to defeat a repurposed alibaba drone is useful it doesn't really help if you're facing a Predator that's the size of a school bus.",3,1735107606.0

Comment,m3p1mzk,m3nt1zb,Druggedhippo,"> They will have better experience

Just because you survive a war doesn't mean you learned anything. Many will have PTSD and be useless, and forget being properly treated for that.

And even if they do come back without any severe psychological issues, any experience needs to be transferred and adapted into their culture.

Russia has been exposed to Western training for decades and still has their rigid command structure and inflexible unit compositions. Their hazing and culture of shifting blame and lying just isn't conducive to allowing real actual learning to take place within their military.

Will North Korea be able to actually *utilize* the lessons they learn, merge them into their training, update their training and teach new and existing soldiers the lessons?

Biggest struggles from my pov are: 
- both parents need to work to survive, who cares for the child? Why bear children if a care person is seeing it more than u? If you happen to get a childcare spot that is.
- housing: not enough room for offspring, no multigenerational homes
- specialized education that take well into your mid/end 20s with highly theoretical knowledge that you need to collect years of practical knowledge on top shortening the time frame to have children
- highly specialized jobs requiring ppl to move, suddendly your personal social net is gone including your childhood love
- rent/cost of living eats up your -oh so high- income
- uncertainity about retirement, basically have to fund the current elders and my own retirement. but how much to save? noone is telling u
- lacking job security and if you are a or becoming a parent employers try to get rid of u
- modern parental guidelines (WHO) are basically impossible to follow throughoutly and without excessive help of extended familly which is not possible since they are too old due to your long education and live far away cause you moved for job and are actually working instead of breastfeeding 2yrs since (paid) parental leave is only a fraction of that

Basically, unless you can live off of interest, you are a modern slave who ""needs"" to work to pay for living and can't have children. They cranked their slaves too hard now into non reproductivity.

Why now poorer people have more children? Throw WHO guidelines out of the window (raise ipad kids), live off of wellfare with nothing to leave for your offspring (inheritance, familly home) and retirement is now (wellfare). But not everyone can live off of wellfare.

If they done nothing they could have some relevance for at least another generation, but were too narcissistic and proud to realize Caesar was their best alternative. The public hated them, the generals could barely contain their contempt for them or cared about what it was they decreed. They basically doubled in size thanks to Caesar. Killing Caesar destroyed their power entirely. The hilarious aspect about it though was later emperors hated just how incompetent the Senate was.

If you're a straight white male.   But it wasn't all gravy.  You need to look into what *percentage* of the population actually had the things, or situation, that Reddit often takes as the norm for that era.   Look also at the poverty rate, home ownership rate, the size of the homes, etc.   

Some things were better just by virtue of the negative consequences of the great things of that era not having manifested yet.  Many of those great jobs of the era were due to the arms race, buildout of suburbia, and buildout of the interstate highway system.   Which gave us the huge DoD and military-industrial complex, suburban sprawl, and widespread car dependence we have today.   And the focus on preserving that suburbia resulted in R1 zoning that choked off housing supply and thus led to upwardly spiraling home prices.

>more food per person

Food needs farmers, transport, etc.  Supply chains needs workers to maintain them.  As do roads, rail systems, etc.   

It's not just that we'll have fewer people.  We'll also have a much older population, so more retirees per worker.   So either you squeeze the young harder, or you cut elder benefits.

Or just on there being enough young people to pay for retiree benefits, and to care for the old, and to do the work needed.   The young have always been the ones to care for the old.   If you have fewer workers per retiree, you either squeeze them harder, or you cut retiree benefits.  Since retirees will be a much higher proportion of the electorate, well, they won't be voting to cut their own benefits.   

It's not clear that *any* ""system"" would be immune from the problems posed by a fertility rate this low.  1.8, 1.6, maybe, since the population decline would be relatively gradual.

With a sub-replacement fertility rate, your population continues to decline.   Even if you don't care for retirees at all, just let them go feral in the street, you still have ever-fewer workers.   Of course, the retirees *vote*, and there will be more of them, so it's not clear how you'd just cut off their benefits.   I guess you could just start murdering them.  

But the older the population, the older the electorate, the less forward-looking or future-oriented that society will be.    I don't see any basis for ""nah, I think it'll work out"" that isn't just a fantasy.   Usually it's predicated on some idea that things will self-correct when the population gets smaller, and the population will ""stabilize"" and we'll ""live in balance"" or something.

Comment,m3lhbbd,m3l46ra,Hopeful-Sir-2018,"To be fair - a fuck load of people don't understand those things. I mean for fucks sake - people think the US debt works *just* like their household debt. They've never read about the time we had no debt and the consequences that came from that.

Keeping a larger country running is super complex and tough.

One of the best ways I've explained how tough this is was to go: ""Ok, you're elected President. You have 2 months to find people to fill this list of positions that are competent in each field. Go."" And when they see the list their eyes get huge. Yeah, it's tough because there's a shit load of fields. And each and every one of them has an impact on a fuck load of people.

If you put someone in charge of energy, for example, and they fuck it up - look at the amount of people whose jobs you just fucked. Now do that for every field.

*How* the US go to be this bureaucratic and inefficient is because it's tough making everyone happy and not fucking up. European countries have been doing this longer than we have. And they fucked up themselves plenty of times.

>  It's because the US is so wealthy that we can't spend all our liquidity here.

This one is uniquely tough because once you start buying internationally - you also become somewhat reliant on other countries. This is what we mean when we say global economy. This means when a problem in Japan hits an industry - it's felt world wide. When a company that produces microchips has an earthquake and is fucked for a while - this means local companies that rely on that get fucked too.

And, more importantly, the US doesn't have every unique resources. Some things are rare and only found in certain places (think: the magnets in HDD's that read things).

Some things, like oil, you want to hoard and use other people's stuff first so you have a backup supply if shit goes south.

The reality is - everything is complex and *well* beyond a lay persons understanding. Hell, I'm sure even I'm wrong in a few ways that I'm trying to articulate this.

They also gloss right over all of the reasons the holocaust happened and what lead up to it, which is probably the most important history lesson there is. 

So I think that in Florida and several other red states a teacher can't put any moral values on things like genocide. Like you're expected to just say ""this happened"" and can't say it was bad. If they even teach about things like that at all. Here in SC in the 80s and 90s all we got was ""Europeans came here and made friends with the Indians who later decided they'd rather live out West. The morally perfect Founding Fathers were good enough to give homes to some Africans who did a few of the odd jobs, but they were primitive so the Europeans had to feed and clothe them and give them medicine. That's how the white man brought civilization to these primitives, and they were very grateful - most fought in the war of Northern Aggression to save their beloved plantation owners from the tyranny of economic oppression that banning slavery would bring.

Comment,m3lnl3f,m3ljdx3,New_Excitement_4248,"Bad how? It's not like America is going to go on some expansionist rampage conquering the world. That's a move for nations in more dire straits.

What's happening is that Russia is waging a very successful, and at one time very covert war against American (and European) supremacy on two fronts: the wealthy elite and propaganda.

All they had to do was throw a shit ton of money at the pain points of Western culture: immigration, racism, religious conservatism.

It's the same act they're pulling in Europe. Instead of Mexican/Central/South American immigration, it's middle-eastern immigration. Instead of racism against black people and a history of slavery, it's more cultural racism against the conservative Islamic cultures coming from across the Mediterranean. Instead of Southern Baptist Christian Fascists, it's a secular resistance to the aforementioned Islamic immigrants and the hyper-conservative values they import.

The key to this strategy is that these pain points are not invented whole-cloth. They're real issues Americans and Europeans are facing that Russia exploits by buying politicians and shoveling money and propaganda on the fire.

The goal is destabilization. If Russia can't rise above American and European power, then they will attack the knees and try to bring the powers down to their level.

And it's been working amazingly for them, although the war has landed them back in trouble. 

America is lost, Russia won that war. But Europe is still putting up a fight. There's a movement that the Russians NEED to prevent, which is a militarily cooperative and unified European Union dedicated to preventing Russian expansion into Ukraine.

But Europe isn't safe. Every election more nations move far-right due to the pressing of the pain-points. They got Brexit. Italy and Hungary gave in to the far-right, for example. Perhaps France next will fall to these proto-fascist parties bankrolled by Russsia.

The question isn't ""what will America do as they lose influence and power?"" it's ""what will Russia do once it wins its global culture war?""",68,1735052655.0

America will absolutely use that power to maintain the status quo, if they don’t their way of life ends, especially for every billionaire in the country

Not that soon after W. W Bush was the aberration that the sane world tried to brush aside. Literally why Obama won the Nobel peace prize: he was a return to sanity after W. And T makes W look like a sane world leader by comparison, which he absolutely never was.

Trump 1 made it clear the US could no longer be trusted, it's just that most countries move very slowly to adapt. That first term was about how the US couldn't be trusted for more than 4 years. The 2nd term means they can't ever be trusted. Probably leading to a European army, which for Putin will be one hell of a monkey paw curse.

And now there's likely to be a more radical shift as the US cedes the technology race to China in many key areas, making the US less relevant with time, depending on where the key developments in AI happen. The country is lucky it still has enormous cultural influence with films and music and so on, otherwise there'd be little of the old good will left.

Leaving the US, going into Canada the Border guards greeted me heartily, asked where I was going and why, and then proceeded to give me some tips to make the trip more interesting / good stops on the way and told me to enjoy my day. 

When I returned to the US on the same evening, the US border guards gave me a very big side eye why I'm returning to the US from Canada so soon (same day), queried me why I'm coming back, where I'm going, and why I was in Canada in the first place. Made me feel very much like my presence is bothering them.

Comment,m3pcthg,m3p8nyx,himynameis_,"> find an optimal design and mass produce them.

Thought I heard that is what France did decades ago when they built a lot of them. 

I've been digging a lot into Nuclear energy (out of interest) and the phrase ""cost overrurn"" always comes up. 

Even in SMRs, NuScale had a contract in Ohio, but they had cost overruns as well and had to scrap the project. I think the cost came out double the original contract. Idea with SMRs is, because they would have to product more, they may be able to achieve manufacturing scale and efficiencies. But to do that, they need the *sales* to manufacture more... 

NuScale is trying to produce for Romania and Poland now, so let's see how that goes. I think NuScale is the only SMR that got the necessary approvals in the USA too. 

Been looking at Radiant which is producing Microreactors, so I'm still hoping... 

But some good news is after a long while, Bill Gates Terrapower is building a Nuclear Plant in Wyoming that has the Natrium reactor which uses liquid sodium, reducing the cost. So hopefully that works... Expected to be operating in 2030.",8,1735108147.0

AMATEURS!

Hinkley Point C £18bn and due 2023 at start.  Then before construction it was delayed to 2025. Jan 2021 £22–23bn and 2026, By 2022 was 2027 and £25bn, Feb 2023 £31-32bn, Jan 2024 £31-35bn and due 2029-2031.  These are 2015 prices, excluding interim interest, in todays money it’s about £41.6–47.9.

So every year costs increase a few £billion and delays a bit over a year.  Good news the construction overrun costs are being paid for by the French tax payer.

It is also excluding the high electricity cost, which will be another £25bn (2012 prices).  Strike price was originally estimated to be £24 per MWh but was actually £89.50 per MWh, if hit target and as requested £93.50 MWh.  The strike price at the time was £40 for other sources.

Nuclear is not as dangerous as you are making it to be. In 70 or so years, we have had two ""major"" incidents. Not that bad, really. Fukushima was a fluke, Chernobyl incompetence. I'm sure far more have died from coal/gas plants.

Currency is easily used for transactions by its nature, in contrast to food aid or equipment, which means the gangs with currency would be able to trade externally, and only get stronger. 

I'm absolutely not saying investment is bad. Haiti absolutely needs purely financial investment like jobs, but it needs stability at the same time. 

I'm only concerned that throwing some buildings on the shoreline, throwing some cash at the locals, and leaving the rest of the island to fend for itself might actually make the situation worse.

But the reality is that it isn't apathy that is keeping other nations from deploying boots on the ground but informed caution. 

Real life is far too complex for easy solutions. The underlying reasons why those states failed and became unpoliceable are the same factors that will corrupt any foreign force you send there.

Comment,m3p46gv,m3om5b7,MrBeetleDove,"Political benefit vs altruism is a false dichotomy.  Oftentimes they intersect -- US support for Ukraine could be an example, for instance.

There are also some historical cases where the US and others intervened despite not having a major national interest.  Consider just a few recent examples: the Gulf War, the Kosovo War, or [2011 intervention in Libya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_Libya#Responsibility_to_protect).  [This](https://www.amazon.com/United-Nations-History-Stanley-Meisler-ebook/dp/B0071BWS0Q/) is a good book if you want to learn more about the history of humanitarian military interventions (including ones from the 1900s that most people have forgotten about).

I would actually argue that with regard to Haiti in particular, there is very little strategic benefit for any nation getting involved there.  So, all of the interventions in Haiti have been (failed) humanitarian interventions.

Cynical redditors always like to frame everything in terms of national interest.  Be careful, that could be a [self-fulfilling prophecy](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1h8z3ul/assad_regime_in_syria_may_fall_in_days_us/m0ywm48/).

Comment,m3ot57w,m3oawvo,Exano,"So you're both wrong and right.

Haiti has a population of 11 million, or approx the same amount as Michigan. We've got ~330 million. Currently we've got 800k Haitian immigrants (total in the last 30 years. 

So, all this is to say, is that if the entirety of Haiti were to magically move to America with my genie finger, our pop would increase by about .03%

So, it would be enough to be impactful, for sure, but to say it'd be a revolutionary or cultural change is being a little hyper dramatic. Given that we already have a pretty established french/creole culture, I imagine most people would not notice at all. 

Now, obviously America doesn't want a failed narco state on its doorstep. We should try to prevent it, but there aren't too many good moves. We have too many allies to go to war with first. 

All this is to say the reality is even their entire country wouldn't move the needle to such a degree that the country would dramatically shift. This isn't an endorsement of that by any means, just a smidgen of perspective.

Another prospective is that we do not get to choose our neighbors - and having them be destitute, uneducated and trapped in violent circumstances not only encourages MORE illegal immigration, but it decreases the potential output of those immigrants.

So, we should push for a safe, well educated neighborhood, or we'll learn, as you are trying to point out that our shitting on the neighbors porch meant they're lighting dog poo on ours.

There isn't a government to depose, just a bunch of gang leaders to take out. I think with this one you could get the support of the ordinary people who are probably desperate for this to end. 

Yes soldiers will die, but not to be blunt but that's the job sometimes. It's part of the risk of being a soldier, you might end up in combat. And if they did end up in combat in Haiti at least it's a noble cause, because rescuing those people from the gang leaders is a noble cause. 

And it's not like Afghan, with its location you could easily open up trade links due to its location and build up the nation to something that can be prosperous.

The problem is that no government can ever have legitimacy if it was put into power by a foreign state.

It's pretty obvious that if the US for example agrees to a transfer of power to a national government they won't be doing this with anyone who happens to be there. It would only give the control to someone they are in good relations in that will offer some sort of guarantee of being friendly to the US in the future.

And you might say: ""just organize some elections and let the people choose the members of the parliament"". Well, that would happen anyway sooner or later but MPs are just the public face of the state, the rest of bureacrats and employees of the state apparatus will most probably be people that the US chose or at least filtered as to get rid of the ones that were hostile to them. There will always be a reasonable suspicions that there are people in key positions that are more loyal towards the US for putting them there than to the national interests of the country.

Comment,m3otvko,m3ncpi5,nuvo_reddit,"Someone associated with marine told that Russians are getting it increasingly tough to source parts for their machines including ships. Russia is greatly dependent on Europe, particularly Germany for machinery. It’s the reverse case of Germany gas. 

Germany got cheap gas from Russia and produced high quality parts at low cost. Just like Germany did not develop alternative, Russian too did not develop their.

Machines are great equaliser. They don’t care if they are being operated by Russian or European. Without maintenance, failure is inevitable. 

Going forward Russian probably would reverse engineer the critical parts through China. But that would take time and till then such failures would happen.",21,1735097687.0
Comment,m3ozgsk,m3otvko,Legal-Diamond1105,"The interdependence was intentional. The first iteration of the EU was built on the premise that full economic integration between Germany and France would make a war between them impossible. Their reliance on each other would prevent them from fighting.

The same trick was tried with Russia. The flow of German Euros to Russia encouraged Russia to buy German (and other European) goods. That caused native manufacturing to decay, why open a new Lada plant if Germany will send you BMWs in exchange for that gas that just comes out of the ground.

The theory was that the interdependence would make a war so pointlessly destructive and peace so rewarding that Russia would stop acting the way Russia has for a thousand years. Nobody would be that self destructive.

Russia promptly said “hold my vodka” and blew it all up. The gas trade wasn’t stupid, the leverage went both ways.",31,1735100553.0

For the brotherhood of Turks and Kurds, this is what happened to Leyla Zana for saying exactly those words (this is only 30 years ago btw, a few years before I was born).


> Political career (Leyla Zana wiki page)

>After the arrest of her husband Mahdi Zana, she and other relatives of prisoners tried to raise awareness for the prisoners situation.[2] Against Mehdi Zana have been pressed charges for publishing poetry in the Kurdish language.[2] In 1987, Leyla Zana was arrested for the first time for two months for taking part in a rally against torture.[2] In 1991 Zana was elected to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey on behalf of the Social Democratic People's Party (SHP).[4] She created a scandal when she spoke Kurdish on the floor of the parliament after being sworn in, even though it was known to be illegal. The Kurdish language, even when spoken in private, had been illegal for years in Turkey. Only in that year, 1991, was the Kurdish language finally legalized, though speaking Kurdish remained illegal in public spaces, as Zana was sworn in.[5] Her remarks ended,

>I swear by my honor and my dignity before the great Turkish people to protect the integrity and independence of the State, the indivisible unity of people and homeland, and the unquestionable and unconditional sovereignty of the people. I swear loyalty to the Constitution. I take this oath for the brotherhood between the Turkish people and the Kurdish people.[6]

> Only the final sentence of the oath was spoken in Kurdish: ""I take this oath for the brotherhood between the Turkish people and the Kurdish people.""[6] In response to this, calls for her arrest blaming her of being a ""Separatist"" and ""Terrorist"" were heard in the Turkish parliament.[7]",8,1735082705.0

Capitalism didn't invent trade, and no prominent communist writer has ever said trade should not happen. Claiming Cuba or communists are hypocritical for wishing to engage in trade is just ignorant.

Hell, Marx himself was in favor of free trade as the logical advance of capitalism, which he saw as a necessary step in building socialism:

>But, in general, the protective system of our day is conservative, while the free trade system is destructive. It breaks up old nationalities and pushes the antagonism of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie to the extreme point. In a word, the free trade system hastens the social revolution.

Comment,m3lrkp0,m3la6y7,MightyKittenEmpire2,"\>Why do you think that is? Is it a nihilistic perspective that organizing to do good is futile?  


The first goal of every large organization is to protect the organization.  The second goal of every org is to grow the org.  The stated mission of the org, like saving souls, feeding the poor, healing the sick, or furthering democracy, is somewhere several levels down in priority.  

Why?  When people are employed by the org, even if some of those people are very self sacrificing, the nature of people is to do what is best for themselves and their family.  So if the org is jeopardized, the individual employee's livelihood is jeopardized.  If the org grows, the employee's opportunities for personal gain are enhanced.  

An easy example is that the stated goal of the Catholic church is to save souls.  But the church widely and consistently chose protecting itself from bad press (which translates to lost income and gov't support) rather than protect their most vulnerable members, children who believed that the mission of the church was sacred.  

Gov't agencies almost always grow organically bc every employee's job security and promotion and pay advancement opportunities are enhanced when they create larger programs that expand the agency.  

That doesn't mean that organizing to do good is futile, it just means that there must be constant vigilance and oversight to rein in the scope and powers of the org and refocus it on its planned mission.",3,1735054107.0
Comment,m3le76t,m3la6y7,tholovar,"No. I do not believe that organizing to do good is futile, just that any any communal organization is made up of multiple individuals all with differing standards/ideas of ""morality"".

This has been going on for a while, Pius XII was infamously criticized for not speaking out more in WW2.  The excuse now is that he was afraid that the Vatican/Catholics would be attacked.  What's Francis' current excuse?

This fear of offending Russia has also been going on for decades.  According to Catholic belief they claim that the Virgin Mary told them at Fatima to consecrate Russia.  Yet Pope John Paul II did not name Russia in his 1980s consecration, and consecrated ""the world"", reportedly out of fear of offending Russia.  Pope Francis finally consecrated Russia by name decades later... after this Ukrainian war had already started.

Regardless of whether you believe in the validity of these Marian apparitions (or if you consider them benevolent or malevolent if you think something supernatural actually happened), the actions of the church seem to indicate that they're more concerned about offending the Russian government than the very deity they claim to worship.

Basically Hitler wanted the Catholic Churches politcal support regarding his treatment of the Jews but knew they opposed his stance towards different ethnics groups in general (race/ethnicity were interchangable terms at the time) and so was content to at least have their silence and neutrality.

Mussolini wanted to annex and formally claim all remaining Papal holdings, and was held back by Hitler who was concerned with a revolt by Catholics in Germany and occupied territories.

So officially the Vatican chose strict formal neutrality as they had next to no military strength to prevent any actual army.

They signed a concordat with Mussolini and Hitler that they wouldnt openly move against them but still worked in the shadows against some fascist policies. The church for example was fundamental in stopping the T4 extermination plan by raising a big stink over the liquidation of the disabled.

Several individual Cardinals and priests however were fully supportive of the Nazis and even aided them. But this war more regional - for example in Croatia or Slovakia where the local church stood behind the Nazi puppet regimes. Those were also the avenues through which the later rat lines developed.

But the Catholic Church as a whole was pretty antagonistic towards the Nazis - which is no surprise as even religious Nazis preferred Protestantism as it had been less internationalist and more nationalist-jingoist than the comparably ""weak woman-willed papists""",44,1735036549.0

Comment,m3kv9rx,m3kkodp,Malgus20033,"While it is ironic that a man in charge of an organization that shaped what the West is today is against(or at least not for) the West, that is generally the sentiment in much of Latin and especially South America. They view anything involving America and Western Europe as the fault of Western meddling because their politicians choose to blame others for issues they choose not to solve. Nations like Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina had the chance to be on the same level as France but chose to pocket money regardless of party and ideology affiliation. And since things aren’t getting better, they get to blame the West for that every year because “Spain/Portugal stole our gold in 1500 AD” or “America overthrew our government X years ago,” the latter of which is fine only if you are in Central America. Many of them also despise the US and therefore the West for meddling in Latin America during the War on Drugs. However, South Americans are almost entirely responsible for their own issues today, as they continue to elect jackasses who do nothing to improve their countries and keep getting richer, while fueling the idea that this is all the West’s fault. This is pretty much the same strategy russia uses to make its citizens support the government and hate the West.

Even tho everyone praises Lula for not being Bolsonaro, a left wing anti West populist with exclusively authoritarian allies is not good either.

Also the Falklands War for the pope. Argentina started it but that’s not the way they see it.

Anyways sorry for the rant but being raised in such an environment caused the creation of a man like Pope Francis. I don’t believe Latin America (at least anything south of Mexico) was ready to produce a Pope but hey I’m not Catholic or a Cardinal so it’s not really my choice lol.

The pontiff criticized European weapons deliveries to Ukraine while calling for peace negotiations, yet notably refrained from urging Russia to withdraw its invasion forces or release deported Ukrainians.

Pope Francis, commenting on the war in Ukraine for Orbe 21 channel, stated that it is hypocritical to talk about peace while simultaneously arming it against Russia’s aggression, Vatican News reported.

Once again, the pontiff neither urged Russia to withdraw its troops from Ukraine nor called on the Kremlin to release forcibly deported Ukrainians. Any negotiated peace with Russia would likely lead to the partial or full legalization of Russia’s control over the parts of Ukraine it has occupied. Despite the widespread outrage these statements consistently provoke, Pope Francis continues to advocate for talks with Russia without directly urging it to end its war of aggression.

Speaking about the situation in Ukraine, Pope Francis expressed concern that numerous appeals for peace from international organizations were ignored. He also sees a contradiction between promoting peace and investing in military capabilities.

He directed specific criticism at Europe for its ongoing supply of weapons to Ukraine, emphasizing that arms manufacturing remains one of the continent’s most profitable sectors.

“We organize conferences and meetings, yet we continue producing weapons to kill,” he said.

The Pope also warned of a “general tendency toward self-destruction through war.” He called for an urgent peace treaty but noted that discussions about peace often get bogged down in secondary issues. He voiced particular concern over “young Ukrainians being sent to the front lines,” adding that “Ukraine has few men left, while Russia has many.”",73,1735020942.0

You may disagree, I in fact disagree and he can be criticised for being wrong but that doesn’t make him a Russian stooge or pro-killing Ukrainians or corrupt in some other way like people are suggesting.

My own opinion is that I do highly suspect (without evidence of conspiracy I’ll admit) that the arms industry has intentionally benefited from the slowed transfer of arms and authorisation to use arms in certain circumstances to Ukraine to the extreme detriment of Ukraine and with the intention of dragging out the war. The pope is correct when he says it is an evil industry with control over politicians.

Since the conflict began in 2011, Syria has seen a fragmentation of authority, with numerous rebel groups, militias, and foreign-backed factions controlling various regions of the country.

In the early stages of the war, many armed groups, including those backed by Western powers, Turkey, and Gulf states, fought against the government of President Bashar al-Assad. However, as the war progressed, the Assad regime regained significant territory, primarily with support from Russia and Iran. The government's aim is to integrate these rebel and militia groups into the official military structure to strengthen its hold on power and reduce external influence within Syria.

The recent agreement comes at a time when the Syrian government is seeking to solidify its control over the country and diminish the presence of foreign-backed militias. This includes groups supported by countries like the U.S., Turkey, and Iran. The move is also viewed as part of Syria's broader efforts to restore its sovereignty after years of foreign intervention. However, the situation remains volatile, as various armed groups may still resist integration, and local dynamics between different ethnic and religious communities could complicate the process.",37,1735061904.0

Comment,m3o8bkx,m3nxjws,fanglesscyclone,"To play devils advocate, Poland is buying a lot of different kinds of equipment from all over the place, Ukraine was a blessing in a way since they could offload all their soviet era stuff to them so they don’t have to deal with maintaining Russian and American jets at the same time. Not to mention the confusion that causes for training pilots. 

This goes the same for their tanks, they had mostly soviet tanks and soviet derived domestic models, some German leopards, American Abrams, and now they’ve bought a whole lot of Korean tanks along with the expertise to manufacture them. This is good in the long term if they full plan to phase out their old tanks but if a war broke out now or next year they’d have a real hard time with maintenance.

I wouldn’t be very happy about all these purchases if I worked in Polish military logistics. There’s more to an army than just raw equipment numbers. Ukraine is dealing with similar problems but it’s out of necessity, Poland is going to be dealing with the same problem but out of a lack of forethought.

The allies were able to get a leg up in WWII because of superior supply of equipment that was standardized, sure there were varieties of say, British and French tanks, however each respective power retained their own military engineering companies to repair and maintain their own equipment. The problem that the polish may face, and granted the information landscape may be different, is trying to maintain and supply a variegated retinue of military equipment, each holding to its own standards and design parameters. In a hot war, things move fucking fast and you don’t have two or three weeks to get specialty replacement bearings for a tank from hundreds of miles away.
